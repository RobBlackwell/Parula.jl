# Parula

The MATLAB&trade; Parula colour map implemented as a Julia
ColorScheme.

As far as I can tell, you can't copyright a colour map but you could
patent it. I don't think MathWorks have such a patent, but beware, if
you use this in your work.

My own motivation is to test Parula against other, perceptually
uniform colour maps.

## Usage

```
using Parula

print(parula.colors)
```
